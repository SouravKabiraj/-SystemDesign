- HIGH LEVEL DESIGN -
CDN - We are going to use CDN to store all static content.

GATEWAY SERVER - Front end application will first interact with our gateway service. Gateway will
 first validate the request by calling auth service.

AUTH SERVICE - Auth service is used for authentication. To authenticate a request, sometimes it needs user data.
 At that time it will interact with user service.

USER SERVICE - User Service will handle all user related request.

URL SERVICE - Url service is kind of back bone of the system. It will handle all POST and GET request for short
 url.
