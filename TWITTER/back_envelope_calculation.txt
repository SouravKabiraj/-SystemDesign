- Back Of The Envelope Calculation -

Number of tweet per day = 100 million

Amount of storage per tweet = 70byte

Total Storage par day for Tweet = 100 million * 70bytes = 10,000,000 * 70byte
                                     = 7000MB
                                     = 7GB

Total Storage par year for Tweet = 7GB * 365
                                 = 2555 GB = 2.6TB

for comments also almost amount of storage will be needed.

On an average a web server can handle 1000 requests per second

Post/Comment/Like per second = 500 million / (24*60*60) = 5785

So number of server needed to handle post = 6 or 7 server will be good enough
