Every day [Notification Orchestrator Service] will select a set of preferences for which we have to send email.
    // CURRENT DATE 1st May | FRIDAY

    SELECT * FROM NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE WHERE FREQUENCY = "DAILY"

    SELECT * FROM NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE WHERE FREQUENCY = "WEEKLY" AND FREQUENCY_DATA = "FRIDAY"

    SELECT * FROM NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE WHERE FREQUENCY = "MONTHLY" AND FREQUENCY_DATA = "1"

Now we know to whom we have to send notification for today. Notification Orchestrator Service sends all this data
    to Notification Service in async way (Kafka/SQS we can use here).

    content provider service will create content by seeing this categoryId in NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE records.

    Notification Service gets email body from content provider and email id from User Service and using fanout
    process it will send all the data.
