- Back Of The Envelope Calculation -
1. Expecting 10 million user
    Database required to store 10 million notification preference

                    userId: 01,            -------->  12bytes
                    categoryId : CAT07,    -------->  12bytes
                    frequency : DAILY,     -------->  1bytes
                    frequencyData : MONDAY  -------->  1bytes

                    Total [26bytes required for each record]

    so, the DB size is       10 million * 26bytes  = [0.26 GB]

    Say per month new 10000 user will register
                 10000 * 26bytes = [.26MB] new storage required every month


2. Bearable Downtime - Size should be configurable from 1hr/year to 6days/year

3. Response time - We can compromise in case of response time as we are sending email.
    It may take 10-15min to reach user device.
