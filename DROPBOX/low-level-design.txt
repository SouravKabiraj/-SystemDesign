When A user read/uploads a file, it send the request to Gateway server. It authenticates the request by using
Auth/Permission server. Auth Server keep tracks whether an user has permission to access a specific file.
If the req is valid it send the request to File orchestrator. File orchestrator send the file to clunker to create chunks.
Chunker sends the chunk files to File manager to store it in Object Storage.


Say UserA shared a file "fileNew" with UserB.
When UserA and UserB opens the file then Notification creates a socket connection with those users.
UserA made some changes
    1. Specific chunk will be updated by File Management service
    2. File Management service push an chunk update event in Queue
    3. Notification Service take that event and notify others (UserB).

* Notification Server creates socket connection with users.
