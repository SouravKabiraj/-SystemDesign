- HIGH LEVEL DESIGN -
We are going to use object storage to store all the files.
Each files will be divided into multiple parts called "chunks"
File Metadata will keep a track of all the chunks and its different version

"File Orchestrator" will get the file from the user and send that to "Chunker Service"
Chunker service create chunks and send those chunks to "file management service" to store in object storage.
Every Chunk has ID. Chunker returns those to "File Orchestrator" after creating chunks.

Suppose multiple users are accessing same file.
User1 made some changes to the file.

User1 -> Gateway Service -> File Management Service -> OBJ STORAGE
                                    |
                                  QUEUE
                                    |
Other Users <-----------    Notification Service
