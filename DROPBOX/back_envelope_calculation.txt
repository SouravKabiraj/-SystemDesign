- Back Of The Envelope Calculation -
1. Number of User - 500 Millions
2. Number of Document per file - 10 files
3. Total number of files - 5000 Millions = 5 billions
4. Storage needed to store files -
                    say avg size of file - 1MB
                    5 billions * 1MB = 5,000,000,000 MB = 5000TB = 5PB
5. File related request per second - 50,000
                    average request time = 500ms
                    10000 concurrent request can be handled

                    1 server instance can serve 250 request within 500ms
                    in 1sec - 500 request can be handled

                    Number of instance required to handle 50k request is 50000/500 = 100
                    So we need 100 Instance always up.
