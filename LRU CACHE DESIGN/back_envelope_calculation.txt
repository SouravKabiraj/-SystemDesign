- Back Of The Envelope Calculation -
1. Cache Size - Size should be configurable (range ~ 8GB to 100GB or more)
for a small system (like demo projects) it will be very small
for a huge system like youtube.com it will be extremely big
    So RAM size should be configurable

2. Bearable Downtime - Size should be configurable from 1hr/year to 6days/year

3. Response time - Avg response time expected as low as 6-15 m.sec
