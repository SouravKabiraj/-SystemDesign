- Back Of The Envelope Calculation -
1. Number of User = 10 Millions
2. Number of new blog in one day = 10K
3. Number of read per day for a post = 1K

Increase in DB per year for blog
    = 365 * 10,000 * 20KB
    = 73GB

Increase in User DB per year (avg)
    = .5 Million

Expected number of instance
    = number of post per day * number of read per post / number of request per sec an instance can handle
    = 10,000 * 1,000 / 15000
    = 666
